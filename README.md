Problem statement from the competition -HR Analytics (analytic Vidhya)

Your client is a large MNC and they have 9 broad verticals across the organisation.
One of the problems your client is facing is around identifying the right people for promotion (only for a manager position and below) and prepare them in time. 
Currently the process, they are following is: 
They first identify a set of employees based on recommendations/ past performance Selected employees go through the separate training and evaluation program for each vertical. These programs are based on the required skill of each vertical At the end of the program, based on various factors such as training performance, KPI completion (only employees with KPIs completed greater than 60% are considered) etc., the employee gets a promotion.  

They have provided multiple attributes around Employee's past and current performance along with demographics. Now, The task is to predict whether a potential promotee at the checkpoint in the test set will be promoted or not after the evaluation process.



The file contains the datavisualisation.py file which explains the how the data is processed using numpy and pandas.
The visualisation of relation between various features is done using matplotlib and seaborn.
Various hypothesis about the relation between features and the target variable are made and analysed.

Feature selection and model building are done in the file named modelBuildingForImbalanceClassification which shows how the various models are selected and the paremeter tuning affects the classification for imbalance classification 






If you find the code usefull  or have any suggestion for hyperparameter tuning for imbalnce classification please mail me at -
